# ML_Model_Comparison

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of molecules based on their chemical descriptors. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and comparison of two regression algorithms: Linear Regression and Random Forest.

## Results
The Random Forest model outperformed Linear Regression in predicting logS, achieving a lower mean squared error and a higher R² score on the test set.
The notebook compares the performance of Linear Regression and Random Forest models. Evaluation is based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score for both training and test sets.
